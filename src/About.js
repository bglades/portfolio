          <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I have a background in the sciences, with a Bachelor's degree in Biology and an Associate's degree in Respiratory Therapy. During my time as a respiratory therapist, I had the opportunity to work in the surgical robotics department, where I discovered my interest in software engineering. This led me to pursue a Profssional Certification in Coding at MIT, where I gained valuable skills in web development. Further, I obtained a certification in Technical Writing to further my knowledge and skills.

          In addition to my professional pursuits, I am an avid outdoor enthusiast. I love spending time skiing, camping, hiking, paddleboarding, and engaging in various outdoor activities. My passion for the outdoors has even allowed me to contribute as a gear reviewer for Outdoor Gear Lab.

         I am excited to continue my journey as a software engineer and contribute to meaningful projects.
